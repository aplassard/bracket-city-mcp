    # If we want to test the rendering of an end clue that itself has is_end_clue=True
    # then we need to ensure the mock Clue object in the game also has this flag.

    # Let's re-evaluate this test based on new end_clue definition for Clue and Game
    # For an end clue, its rendered text is always its clue_text.
    # The game's end_clues[0] will be such a clue.
    # If the end clue's text itself has dependencies, they would be resolved
    # up to the point of the end clue *displaying* its clue_text.
    # However, the previous Clue.get_rendered_text would return self.answer if self.completed.
    # For an end clue, self.completed is always False, and self.is_end_clue is True,
    # so it directly returns self.clue_text.

    # If #END# is an end clue, its text is "End clue depends on #C1#".
    # If #C1# is completed, it becomes "End clue depends on Ans C1".
    # This part of Clue.get_rendered_text (dependency resolution) happens *before*
    # the check for is_end_clue. This is correct. The final text of the end clue
    # IS its clue_text after its own dependencies are resolved.

    # The previous Clue.get_rendered_text logic:
    # 1. if self.is_end_clue: return self.clue_text (THIS IS WRONG, this was the new code in Clue)
    #    Corrected logic in Clue.get_rendered_text:
    #    1. if self.is_end_clue: return self.clue_text  <-- this is the first check.
    #    2. if self.completed: return self.answer
    #    3. ... resolve dependencies in self.clue_text ...
    # So, if a clue IS an end clue, its dependencies are NOT resolved by its own get_rendered_text.
    # It just returns its literal clue_text.

    # Let's re-verify the Clue.get_rendered_text:
    # def get_rendered_text(self, game: 'Game') -> str:
    #     if self.is_end_clue:  <--------------------------------- THIS IS THE FIRST THING
    #         return self.clue_text
    #     if self.completed:
    #         return self.answer
    #     ... (dependency resolution for current_text = self.clue_text) ...
    #     return current_text

    # So, if a clue is an end clue, its get_rendered_text will *always* be its raw clue_text.
    # The dependencies in its text will NOT be resolved by its own call.
    # This means the final display of the game, which calls get_rendered_clue_text on the end_clue,
    # will show the end_clue's raw text, possibly with unresolved #HASHTAGS# if they were meant
    # to be resolved by the end clue itself.

    # This makes sense for an "end game message" that doesn't change.
    # However, if the end clue's text is like "Congratulations, you solved #C1# and #C2#!",
    # we would expect #C1# and #C2# to be their answers.
    # The current Clue.get_rendered_text, with is_end_clue check first, prevents this.

    # Let's assume the prompt means the *final* game text should be the *resolved* text of the end clue.
    # This implies that the Game.get_rendered_game_text() will call end_clue.get_rendered_text(),
    # and this end_clue, despite being an end_clue, should resolve its *own* dependencies.
    # This means the is_end_clue check in Clue.get_rendered_text should probably NOT be the very first thing.
    # Or, Game.get_rendered_game_text needs a special way to render the end clue.

    # Re-reading Clue.get_rendered_text from previous subtask:
    # def get_rendered_text(self, game: 'Game') -> str:
    #   if self.is_end_clue: return self.clue_text  <-- This was the change.
    #   if self.completed: return self.answer
    #   current_text = self.clue_text
    #   ... resolve dependencies into current_text ...
    #   return current_text

    # This means that indeed, an end clue's text is always its raw text.
    # So, the test case "End clue depends on Ans C1" would be wrong if #END# is an end_clue.
    # It would be "End clue depends on #C1#".

    # Let's assume the `Clue` class behavior is fixed as implemented.
    # The `Game.get_rendered_game_text` just calls `get_rendered_clue_text` on the end clue.
    # So, if the end clue is `#END#`, its text will be its raw clue_text.

    # This makes these specific get_rendered_game_text tests less about complex dependency resolution

    # To properly test the full rendering as it might have been intended before `is_end_clue`'s specific
